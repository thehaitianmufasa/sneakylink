PHASE 4: QUESTIONNAIRE + DOCUMENTS (20-30 MINUTES)
User Mindset
* Emotion: Focused, task-oriented
* Thought: "Just get through this. Tell me what's missing."
* Pain: Confused compliance language
How We Make It Feel Easy (Not Hard)
1. Section-Based (Not One Giant Form)
Questionnaire broken into 6 clear sections:
1. Core Safety (4 questions) - 2 min
2. Insurance (5 questions) - 2 min
3. Employees & Safety Metrics (8 questions) - 3 min
4. Relationships (3 questions) - 1 min
5. [Your Work Type] (10-15 questions) - 5-10 min
   - Electrical Work
   OR Work at Heights
   OR LOTO
   OR Equipment Installation
6. Summary & Review (1 min)


2. Progress Bar (Always Visible)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Compliance Profile  [████░░░░░░] 45%
│  Core Safety Section                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘


3. Smart Branching (Hide Irrelevant Questions)
Q: "Do you have EHS program?"
→ If YES: "Upload your EHS Policy" (document upload)
→ If NO: Skip to next question


Vendor only sees questions relevant to THEM.
4. Document Upload (Inline, Not Separate)
When question asks for document:
"Please upload your EHS Policy"


[Drag & drop zone here]
   or
[Click to browse]


✓ File uploaded: EHS_Policy_2025.pdf
[Replace] [Preview]


No separate "Documents Phase". Just do it when asked.
5. Help Text (Explain Why We Ask)
Do you have incident/accident process?


[?] Why: This is required by all major customers.
    Shows you take safety seriously.


⦿ Yes
○ No


6. Question Types (Simple & Visual)
* Yes/No (Radio buttons)
* Dropdowns (coverage type, state, etc.)
* Date pickers (expiry dates)
* Numbers (employees, hours)
* Text area (descriptions)
* Document upload (policies, certificates)
* Checkboxes (equipment lists)
7. Auto-Save (Never Lose Data)

No "are you sure?" confirmation dialogs

KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES (SACRED)
These are non-negotiable:
1. Smooth - No jarring transitions or confusing moments
2. Simple - Every element has one purpose
3. Easy - Vendor thinks "I can do this" not "what is this?"
4. Fast - Onboarding 2 min, questionnaire 20-30 min, export 1 click
5. Clear - Progress visible, status obvious, next action known
6. Progress - Always shows where vendor is in journey
7. Reassuring - "Auto-saving", "You can update this", "Almost done"
8. Mobile-first - Vendor fills forms on phone while in field
9. Honest - Shows gaps, doesn't hide them
10. Retention - After first export, vendor doesn't want to leave
________________


WHAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING (MVP SCOPE)
* ✗ Team accounts (phase 2)
* ✗ API integrations (phase 2)
* ✗ Auto-submit to platforms (phase 2)
* ✗ Compliance tracking (phase 2)
* ✗ Analytics/reporting (phase 3)
* ✗ Audit trails (phase 3)
We're solving ONE problem: Help vendors prep compliance profile once, export to any customer.
That's it. And we do it really, really well.
________________


SUMMARY
This 7-phase journey is:
* ✓ Smooth (no scary moments)
* ✓ Simple (each phase has one goal)
* ✓ Easy (vendor feels in control)
* ✓ Fast (minimal time investment)
* ✓ Robust (scales from 1 customer to 10+)
* ✓ Retention-focused (vendor doesn't want to leave)
Next step: Wireframes for each phase.
This is the definitive journey. Don't overcomplicate it.
