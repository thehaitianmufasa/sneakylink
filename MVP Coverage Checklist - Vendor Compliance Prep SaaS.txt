WHAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING (MVP)
These are Phase 2+:
* ✗ Team accounts (multiple people at one vendor)
* ✗ API integrations (auto-sync with customer portals)
* ✗ Compliance tracking (which customer asked for what)
* ✗ Analytics/reporting (vendor dashboards)
* ✗ Audit trails (who changed what, when)
* ✗ Custom questionnaire builder (for advanced customers)
* ✗ Auto-submit to platforms (Veriforce, etc.)
* ✗ Mobile app (web first)
* ✗ Multi-language support
* ✗ Advanced notifications (Slack, SMS)
These are nice-to-have. Don't build them yet.

UNKNOWN QUESTIONS (VENDOR HANDLES) ✓
If customer asks for additional compliance questions:
1. Vendor gets email template from us
2. Vendor sends to customer asking for questions
3. Customer sends them a link/questionnaire
4. Vendor fills it out in CUSTOMER'S system (not ours)
5. Vendor submits to customer
We do NOT handle:
* ✗ Building questionnaires per customer
* ✗ Managing 250+ possible questions
* ✗ Tracking which customer asked what
We ONLY handle:
* ✓ 30 core questions
* ✓ Export with core answers
* ✓ Email template to ask for more
Status: COVERED. Clear boundary.

________________


ROBUSTNESS CHECK
Can this scale?
✅ 1 vendor, 1 customer: 30 min total ✅ 1 vendor, 3 customers: 30 min + 5 min + 5 min = 40 min total ✅ 1 vendor, 10 customers: 30 min + (9 × 5 min) = 75 min total ✅ Multiple vendors: Each has their own profile, same flow
Does it handle different requirements?
✅ Coke asks for 10 extra questions: Vendor emails template, fills their system ✅ Amazon asks for 20 extra questions: Same process ✅ Home Depot asks for different work-types: Already selected in onboarding ✅ Each customer gets customized export with their work-types only
Is it simple & smooth?
✅ Vendor feels like they got an upgrade ✅ No overwhelming forms ✅ No confusion about what's missing ✅ No waiting ✅ No multi-step wizards
