Vendor Compliance Prep SaaS - Strategic Plan
Status: Pre-build planning phase Last Updated: Dec 10, 2025 Founder: Mufasa (Jeff Chery)
________________


1. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
The Pain
Vendors spend 60+ days onboarding with compliance platforms (Veriforce, ISNetworld, etc.) because:
* Manual questionnaire completion (repetitive across customers)
* Document hunting and uploading
* Confusing/unclear requirements
* Back-and-forth with verification teams
* Vendors answer SAME questions for EVERY customer
Market Validation
* Direct access: Manage Veriforce database at Coca-Cola
* Vendor feedback: Hear daily complaints about 60-day onboarding
* Real questionnaire data: Extracted full Coke/Veriforce requirements
* Proven demand: Any vendor with 2+ customer relationships needs this
Competition
Existing platforms (PaymentWorks, Gatekeeper, Graphite Connect, SupplierGateway) solve for buyers, not vendors. Gap: No vendor-focused prep tool exists.
________________


2. SOLUTION
Core Concept
"Pre-compliance preparation SaaS for vendors"
Vendors prep compliance profile ONCE → export to ANY customer (Coke, Amazon, Home Depot, etc.)
What We're Building
A simple, clean platform where vendors:
1. Create compliance profile
2. Answer generic questionnaire (once)
3. Upload documents (once)
4. Select which customers they work with
5. Generate customer-specific exports
Why It Works
* Saves vendors 10-20+ hours per customer submission
* Recurring revenue (vendors use repeatedly)
* Scalable (not tied to one platform like Veriforce)
* Obvious ROI (hours saved = money saved)
________________


3. POSITIONING & PRICING
Price Point
$297/month (or ~$3,000/year with discount)
Why this price:
* Vendors save $500-1,000 in hours per use
* Payback in 2-3 submissions (most vendors have 5+)
* Not so cheap it feels disposable
* Not so expensive it creates friction
Target Customer
* Service contractors (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Roofing)
* Vendors required by multiple customers
* Companies with 20-500 employees
* Industries: Construction, Manufacturing, Energy, Logistics
Positioning Statement
"Finally, compliance prep built FOR vendors, not FOR buyers."
Not a compliance management tool. A time-saver.

4. PRODUCT INSIGHT FROM VERIFORCE DATA
Questionnaire Structure (Extracted)
Core Questions (All Vendors): ~30 questions
* Business info (company, contacts, services)
* Safety program (yes/no, conditional docs)
* Insurance (liability, coverage, expiry)
* Subcontractor relationships
* Risk classification (High/Medium/Low)
Work-Type Specific: ~250+ questions across 8-10 work types
* High-Risk (Launch with these):
   * Electrical Work
   * Confined Space Entry
   * Construction Work
   * Hazardous Work / Hot Work
   * Work at Heights
* Medium-Risk (Phase 2):
   * Demolition
   * Equipment Installation
   * Excavation
* Low-Risk (Phase 3):
   * Office-based services
   * Consulting
   * General maintenance
Key Insight: Conditional Logic
Questions branch based on answers:
* "Do you have EHS program?" → YES → "Upload your policy"
* "Do you use subcontractors?" → YES → "List them"
* "Do you work at heights?" → YES → 15+ follow-up questions
Documents Types Required
* Safety policies & procedures
* Insurance certificates (liability, workers comp)
* Training records
* Equipment lists
* Experience declarations
* Purchase orders / contracts
* Inspection records

5. VENDOR JOURNEY (Current State)
Veriforce Experience:
1. Get notified: "Sign up for Veriforce"
2. Create account (confusing)
3. Answer 50+ questions manually
4. Upload documents (one-by-one)
5. Fix unclear feedback (back-and-forth emails)
6. Wait for verification (days/weeks)
7. Repeat for next customer (start over)
8. Total time: 60+ days, 20+ hours of manual work
Pain Points:
* Repetitive data entry
* Unclear what's required when
* No progress visibility
* Slow verification
* Manual document management
* Form errors cause rejections

7. UI/UX PHILOSOPHY
Core Principles
1. Clarity over features - Show what matters, hide complexity
2. Progress visibility - User knows where they are at all times
3. One thing at a time - Not overwhelming
4. Smart defaults - Pre-fill what we can
5. Immediate feedback - Green/red status, not confusion
6. Mobile-first - Vendors fill forms on phone
7. Honest assessment - Show compliance gaps, don't hide them
Design Direction
* Aesthetic: Clean, modern, professional (not corporate)
* Color: Green (compliant), Yellow (warning), Red (missing)
* Tone: Helpful, not bureaucratic
* Speed: Fast load times, instant feedback
The Feel
Should feel like:
* "Someone finally gets my frustration"
* "This is way easier than Veriforce"
* "I can see exactly what I need to do"
* "I'm in control, not confused"

8. MVP SCOPE (Phase 1)
What We Launch With
1. Vendor Onboarding Flow

9. TECHNICAL APPROACH
Stack (CodeForge-based)
* Frontend: Next.js + React + Tailwind
* Backend: API routes + Node.js
* Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* Auth: Clerk
* File Storage: Supabase Storage
* PDF Generation: jsPDF or similar
Why CodeForge
* AI agent can auto-generate forms from question data
* Already has auth, database, storage ready
* Clean architecture for scaling
* Clerk auth handles vendor management
Build Approach
1. Design first - Wireframes for every page
2. AI agent generation - Feed questionnaire CSV → auto-generate forms
3. Manual refinement - Polish UI/UX based on principles
4. Internal testing - Use internal Coke pilot
5. Iterate - Real vendor feedback drives improvements

10. GO-TO-MARKET
Phase 1: Validation (Weeks 1-4)
* Build MVP (3-4 weeks)
* Internal Coke pilot (2-3 vendors)
* Get feedback, iterate
* Ensure it feels "upgrade-like"
Phase 2: Soft Launch (Weeks 5-8)
* Launch to Coke vendor network
* Direct outreach (you know them)
* Offer first month free
* Goal: 5-10 paying customers
* Collect testimonials
Phase 3: Scale (Month 3+)
* Expand beyond Coke vendors
* Add more work types
* Build case studies
* Invest in marketing
First Customer Acquisition
* NOT cold outreach
* Warm: Vendors you already know at Coke
* Proof: "I manage compliance at Coke, built this for vendors like you"
* Offer: Free first month + personal onboarding
* Goal: Early testimonials and case studies

11. SUCCESS METRICS (Phase 1)
What We're Optimizing For
* Time to compliance: < 30 min first time, < 5 min repeats
* User happiness: "This is SO much better than Veriforce"
* Completion rate: > 80% of signups complete profile
* Feature adoption: > 90% use export feature
* Net sentiment: Vendors recommend to peers
NOT Optimizing For (Yet)
* Scale (phase 2)
* Complex features (phase 2)
* Enterprise integrations (phase 3)

12. RISKS & MITIGATIONS
Risk
	Mitigation
	Vendors don't want SaaS (prefer one-time)
	Offer annual discount ($2,997 = $250/mo)
	Platform compliance changes often
	Start with Coke/generic, expand slowly
	Hard to get first customers
	Use your existing Coke vendor network
	UI confuses instead of helps
	Test with 3-5 real vendors before launch
	Competitors copy idea
	Build community/network effects fast
	Regulatory/compliance risk
	Disclaimer: prep tool, not legal advice

13. NEXT STEPS (This Week)
Mufasa's Actions
1. Tomorrow: Interview 3-5 Coke vendors about their pain
2. By Friday: Finalize which 4 work-types to launch with
3. Next week: Start building (CodeForge + AI agent)
Claude's Actions (Parallel)
1. Create wireframes for each page (dashboard, questionnaire, documents, export)
2. Design system - Colors, typography, components
3. Copy/messaging - Button labels, help text, status messages
4. Export templates - What does vendor-ready PDF look like?
Validation Gate (Before Build)
* Mufasa gets vendor feedback on concept
* Confirm $297/mo pricing feels right
* Lock in 4 work-types for MVP
* Sign up 2-3 vendors for pilot
________________


14. SUCCESS VISION (6 Months)
Month 1: MVP launched, internal testing Month 2: 5-10 paying Coke vendors Month 3: 20+ customers, add 2 new work types Month 4: Case studies, testimonials, organic referrals Month 5: $5K+ MRR, expand to non-Coke vendors Month 6: Phase 2 features planned
By end of year:
* $10K+ MRR (35+ customers)
* Clear competitive moat (easier to use than Veriforce)
* Vendor community (word-of-mouth growth)
* Expansion to other platforms (ISNetworld, Avetta, etc.)
________________


15. STRATEGIC NOTES
Why This Works
1. Real problem: Vendors genuinely suffer (60-day cycle)
2. Repeatable use: They do this for every customer
3. Clear ROI: Hours saved = money saved
4. Low competition: No one builds for vendors yet
5. Network effect: More customers = more use cases = more value
6. Recurring revenue: Monthly subscription, not one-time
Why It's Different From Chery Solutions
* Chery Solutions: Custom automation consulting ($5-25K per client)
* This SaaS: Scalable product ($297/mo, 50+ customers)
* Both work together: SaaS validates vendor needs → future Chery opportunities
Unfair Advantage
* You manage Veriforce at Coca-Cola (insider knowledge)
* You hear vendor pain daily (authentic problem understanding)
* You know exactly what's required (questionnaire data)
* You have immediate customer network (warm launch)

16. OPEN QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
1. Which 4 work-types to launch with? (Electrical, Confined Space, Construction, Heights?)
2. Annual vs monthly pricing preference? ($297/mo or $2,997/year discount?)
3. Target vendors to interview? (Get 3-5 feedback calls this week?)
4. Build timeline realistic? (3-4 weeks for MVP with CodeForge?)
5. UI design priority? (Wireframes first, or code + iterate?)
6. First pilot location? (Internal Coke vendors or broader network?)
________________


17. DOCUMENT INVENTORY
